# Flowers Image Classifier Project


###### Note :  You should also only enable the GPU when you need it. If you are not using the GPU, please disable it so you do not run out of time!

### information about the project 
Project train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice you'd train this classifier, then export it for use in your application. We'll be using 


### Data
You will be training using 102 different types of flowers, where there ~20 images per flower to train on.  Then you will use your trained classifier to see if you can predict the type for new images of the flowers.
