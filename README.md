##### Project: Flowers_Image_Classifier project : 
Keras/TensorFlow project done as part of the Udacity's Introduction to Machine Learning Nanodegree. It consists on a modified version of Google's MobileNet Convolutional Neural Network, modified with a last layer to adap it to a 102-class flower classifier.

The classifier was trained with the oxford_flowers102 dataset from TensorFlow.
